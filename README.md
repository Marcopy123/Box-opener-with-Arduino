# Box-opener-with-Arduino
I made this box opener with arduino. You will need to install the arduino software from the official site. 

## Material
The things you will need for this project are : 16x2 lcd screen, servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, usb cable, breadboard,
Arduino Uno and some jumper wires.

## How to
The box will be cut at 3 places:
On the top, make two holes able to fit the ultrasonic sensor.
On the left side, to be able to connect the arduino.
On the front, to be able to stick on the lcd screen.

After that, you will need to stick the servo motor on the right side of the box(inside), attach something which will be able 
to lift the cover.

## The diagram

Note : The pin for the servo goes to Pin 6
